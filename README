OVERVIEW

AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a cipher adopted by the U.S. government for its classified documents.
It's secure (all known attacks are computationally infeasible), and fast in both hardware and software.

CTR (Counter) mode is a cryptographic mode that converts a block cipher like AES into a stream cipher
that can be used on any stream of data with arbitrary length. CTR mode has a particularly elegant
implementation, and has been widely adopted.


CHOOSING AN AES ENCRYPTION KEY:

AES supports encryption keys with three lengths, corresponding to increasing levels of security:

NSA rating:   key length:            example key:
SECRET        16 bytes (128 bits)    aN-zx:+_z)UP[`vz
TOP SECRET    24 bytes (192 bits)    Thl\TFvON6J"sb\(VGhw@gTr
TOP SECRET    32 bytes (256 bits)    V<||5DK7KdRYyBLEtY^w~0yk1"#NCZ|N

In general: 1 byte = 1 ASCII character.

See the file "index.php" for a working example.
